# rgb_color_game
A simple guessing game for the browser which helps teach rbg color values. Made solely with HTML5, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

The random rgb colors are generated using Math.floor(Math.random() * 256) three times ("r" "g" and "b"), as rgb values range from 0 - 255 and then by using return to retrieve as whole rgb color.
